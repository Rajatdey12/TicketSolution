DESCRIPTION
-----------------
You need to create a user authentication web app where users can register and login. 
You would be using Spring MVC and MySQL to build this system. Tomcat would be used to serve the app.
The base project structure has been provided in the IDE which includes files like web.xml, spring-servlet.xml, pom.xml, etc.

Getting to know the IDE
The button with name Build in the IDE builds your project and creates a ".war" file and deploys it to tomcat installed in /tomcat/webapps , which is then accessible when Live Preview button is clicked.
Appending the project's name (as mentioned in the pom.xml) will open the respective project in the browser.
A demo project is already present which will be compiled and deployed by clicking on the Build button. Then click on the Reload Workspace icon on the project navigation pane.
You will see a folder named target get generated. Now click on the Live Preview button.
This will open tomcat's homepage in a new tab of your browser.
Append /SpringApp to the url to access the app.

Setting Up the Database
MySQL server is pre-installed and runs on port 3306 in the IDE.
Type mysql -proot in the terminal to login to MySQL server.
Type create database MyUsers;
Do Ctrl+D to exit from the MySQL interface.
Now type mysql -uroot -proot MyUsers < schema.sql
This will initialise the required schema for the app and the table named users will be created as shown below.
Now the database will be accessible from localhost:3306/MyUsers
